# Neovim configuration for an effective workflow on any machine (even headless)

The configuration is written in Lua as are most of the used plugins.

config is based on LunarVim but extremely modified and refactored

### Minimal setup includes
- system-wide fuzzy file finding and grepping (nvim-telescope ï‘«  the best plugin)
    - uses fzf or fzy for file matching
    - uses ripgrep (rg) for text matching
- basic language specific features for ~60 languages (nvim-treesitter)
    - highlighting
    - tree structure
    - indenting
- git helper
    - function wrapper (Neogit in lua, vim-fugitive in vimL)
    - gutter (gitsigns.nvim)
- status bar (galaxyline.nvim)
- top bar (barbar.nvim)
- highly customizable package management (packer.nvim)
- incrementing/decrementing basically anything (dial.nvim)
- key mappings helper (which-key.nvim)
- snippets for most languages (vim-vsnip)
- developer icons (nvim-web-devicons, based on vim-devicons)
- database access (sql.nvim)
- color schemes (nvcode-color-schemes)
- and other stuff (check lua/plugins.lua for a list)

### If you want more functionality checkout
- LSP support (nvim-lspconfig, lspsaga and nvim-compe)
- debugging (nvim-dap in lua or vimspector in vimL)
- ranger file browser (rnvimr)
- testing (vim-ultest)
- efficiency stuff (anything by tpope)
- visual/UI stuff (anything by folke)

### (Optional) Requirements
- A patched font (best just install NerdFonts)
- fzf
- rg
- sqlite3
- git (if it is an old version you may need to tweak packer.nvim config, check their GH)
- neovims base requirements (check neovim build instructions)
